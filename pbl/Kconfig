	  Generate a pbl binary which can relocate itself during startup to run
	  on different addresses. This is useful if your memory layout is not
	  known during compile time.
	  This option only influences the PBL image. See RELOCATABLE to also make
	  the real image relocatable.

	  Generate a pbl binary, which can run from different addresses in RAM as
	  well as eXecute-In-Place from ROM. This requires early board support to
	  relocate the global offset table (GOT) to a known readable writable
	  location.

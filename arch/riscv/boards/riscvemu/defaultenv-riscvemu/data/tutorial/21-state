You'll note most file systems in barebox are read-only. While those that aren't
could be used with `saveenv` to store a packed environment for Linux use, that's
murky waters: atomicity, limiting scope, authentication and journal handling
complicate things. barebox state is the mechanism how barebox stores variables
(and only variables) in a power-fail safe manner that's also accessible to Linux.

Check the `state` device:
```
devinfo state
```

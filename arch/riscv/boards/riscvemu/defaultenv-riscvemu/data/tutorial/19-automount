Strangely, nothing inside `/mnt` is seen in the `mount` output. Why you
ask? Because these are automounts that are deferred until first access.
So when you `bootm /mnt/nfs/boot/Image.gz` the first time, barebox will
bring up the network and mount the network file system (provided you do
have network). We can list what automounts there are:
```
automount -l
```

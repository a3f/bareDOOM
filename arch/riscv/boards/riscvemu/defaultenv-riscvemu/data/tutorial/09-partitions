The `mtdram0` looks interesting. That's the 64K SRAM at the start of the
address space. The virtual machine places the boot "rom" there as well
as the flattened (compiled) device tree (FDT). barebox can be informed
about partitioning and will create extra devices for each partition.
This allows you to reference them from commands easily:
```
of_dump -f /dev/mtdram0.fdt
```

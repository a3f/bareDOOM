As init scripts only run on initialization, we'll have to do a reset to
see them in action. But first, we'll want to save our tutorial progress.
This happens via $global.variables.  Many parts of barebox monitor reads
and writes to such variables to make information available to the shell.

The `next` command also does it. How would you know?
```
magicvar
```

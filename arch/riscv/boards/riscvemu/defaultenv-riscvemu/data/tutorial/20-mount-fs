`/mnt/virtioblk0` is an interesting one. Block device partitions
automatically get automount entries created. On first access,
barebox will determine what file system is located in the partition
and mount it. Thus you can just use `/mnt/virtioblk0/DOOM1.WAD` in
your script and not incur the overhead of mounting unless it's accessed:
```
mount
ll /mnt/virtioblk0/DOOM1.WAD
mount
```

In this tree, you will find 40010000.virtio@40010000.of, the
device corresponding to the device tree node we've just seen.
Devices can have child devices themselves. This device's
grandchild is `cs0`, the virtual console device that prints
you this very text.

See for yourself:
```
  echo -a /dev/cs0 Append this text to virtio console
```

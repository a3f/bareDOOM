In the field, you will probably want to depend exclusively on the built-in
environment, but it can be very handy to persist environment changes during
development. You may recall that barebox told us at first boot that the
environment was never written?  If you don't, no problem, log messages are,
you guessed it, logged:
```
dmesg
```

Now that you know that $global.tutorial.step holds the next step, you
will want to initialize it on the next reset. We could write an init shell
script for that, but there is something much more convenient:

On startup, barebox needs to assign initial values for each
$global.variable; if a suitably named non-volatile $nv.variable already
exists, it will be used as initial value. Let's see what global variables
we got (leading asterisk '*' means it was initialized from NV):
```
global
```

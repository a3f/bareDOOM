We now have seen `/dev`, which holds the devfs, and `/env` which holds the
active environment. `/tmp` is as you have guessed it a directory where temporary
files can be placed. `/pstore` is short for persistent storage, a Linux
mechanism to store and retrieve error records even after a kernel panic.

This leaves `/mnt`. Let's take a peek at it as well at our active mounts:
```
mount
ls /mnt
```

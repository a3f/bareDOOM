`mw` is complemented by `md` for memory display. There are further commands
like `mm` (memory modify), `memcpy` and `memcmp` (copy/compare ranges).
These commands operate on `/dev/mem` by default, but any seekable device
or file can be used instead. Let's see what device files we got here:
```
ls /dev
```

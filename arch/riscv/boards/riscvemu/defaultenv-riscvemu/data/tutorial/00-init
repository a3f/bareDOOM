You are using Hush, barebox' default shell. You are currently using it
interactively, but it can execute scripts as part of the startup and boot
procedure as well. See for yourself:
```
  cat /env/init/90-tutorial-intro
```
Look around as you like. When you are ready to continue the tutorial,
type `next` again. The `prev` command does the inverse and shows previous
tutorial steps. The `help` command will show help usage text,
e.g. `help next`.

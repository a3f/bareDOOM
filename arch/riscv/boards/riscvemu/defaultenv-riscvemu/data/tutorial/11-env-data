The environment you see here is the built-in environment barebox was
compiled with. It contains default values for non-volatile variables,
(init) scripts and data. It's generated from directories on the host
system specified during build and stored as an archive within
barebox. This environment may also be compressed allowing shipping
larger files and even binaries. For example, this barebox binary
has the option CONFIG_DEFAULT_ENVIRONMENT_GENERIC_NEW_IKCONFIG=y,
which ships a copy of the used barebox configuration. See for yourself:
```
cat /env/data/config
```

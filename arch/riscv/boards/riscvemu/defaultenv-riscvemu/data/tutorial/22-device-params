The state driver parses the device tree to learn the state layout
and how it's (redundantly) placed. The information it learns are
registered with the device as device parameters. Device Parameters
make it easy to interact with the shell. For example, the MAC address
of a network adapter is a device parameter. We already saw some other
device parameters before. Those of the global and nv device:
```
devinfo global
devinfo nv
```

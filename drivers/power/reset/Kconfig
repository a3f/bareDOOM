	help
	  This driver supports turning off your board via a GPIO line.
	  If your board needs a GPIO high/low to power down, say Y and
	  create a binding in your devicetree.

config POWER_RESET_GPIO_RESTART
	bool "GPIO restart driver"

	  This driver supports restarting your board via a GPIO line.
	  If your board needs a GPIO high/low to restart, say Y and
	  create a binding in your devicetree.

config POWER_RESET_HTIF_POWEROFF
	bool "HTIF poweroff driver"

	help
	  Adds poweroff support via the syscall device on systems
	  supporting the UC Berkely Host/Target Interface (HTIF).

config NAND_ALLOW_ERASE_BAD
	bool
	depends on MTD_WRITE
	prompt "Add device parameter to allow erasing bad blocks"
	help
	  This adds a 'erasebad' device parameter to nand devices. When set
	  to '1' it will be allowed to erase bad blocks. This is a potientially
	  dangerous operation, so if unsure say no to this option.

config NAND_IMX
	bool
	prompt "i.MX21 to 53 NAND driver aka 'mxc', for NFC"
	depends on ARCH_IMX
	help
	  Support for NAND flash on Freescale/NXP i.MX devices.  This is for the
	  "MXC" series:  i.MX21/25/27/31/35/51/53.

	  This is not for the "MXS" series i.MX processors (23 & 28), or i.MX6
	  and later, which use the GPMI NAND controller from the MXS series. 
	  See the i.MX 'mxs' driver for those chips.

config NAND_FSL_IFC
	bool
	prompt "FSL IFC NAND driver"
	depends on ARCH_LAYERSCAPE
	help
	  Freescale IFC NAND driver for various chips.

config NAND_MXS
	bool
	select STMP_DEVICE
	prompt "i.MX23/28 & 6+ NAND driver aka 'mxs', for GPMI"
	depends on MXS_APBH_DMA
	help
	  Support for NAND flash on Freescale/NXP i.MX devices.	 This is for the
	  "MXS" series:  i.MX23/28 and all i.MX6 and later SoCs.

	  This is not for the "MXC" series of i.MX processors in the i.MX21 to
	  i.MX53 range.  See the i.MX "mxc" driver for those chips.

config NAND_OMAP_GPMC
	tristate "NAND Flash Support for GPMC based OMAP platforms"
	depends on OMAP_GPMC
	help
	  Support for NAND flash using GPMC. GPMC is a common memory
	  interface found on Texas Instrument's OMAP platforms

config MTD_NAND_OMAP_ELM
	bool "Support for ELM (Error Location Module) on OMAP platforms"
	depends on NAND_OMAP_GPMC || COMPILE_TEST
	help
	  This config enables the ELM hardware engine, which can be used to
	  locate and correct errors when using BCH ECC scheme. This offloads
	  the cpu from doing ECC error searching and correction. However some
	  legacy OMAP families like OMAP2xxx, OMAP3xxx do not have ELM engine
	  so this is optional for them.

config NAND_ORION
	bool
	prompt "Marvell Orion NAND driver"
	depends on ARM && (ARCH_KIRKWOOD || COMPILE_TEST)
	help
	  Support for the Orion NAND controller, present in Kirkwood SoCs.

	bool
	prompt "Marvell PXA3xx NAND driver"
	depends on ARCH_ARMADA_370 || ARCH_ARMADA_XP || ARCH_PXA3XX || COMPILE_TEST
	help
	  Support for the PXA3xx NAND controller, present in Armada 370/XP and
	  PXA3xx SoCs.

	depends on ARCH_AT91

config NAND_ATMEL_PMECC
	bool

	  Support for PMECC present on the SoC sam9x5 and sam9n12

config NAND_S3C24XX
	bool
	prompt "Samsung S3C24XX NAND driver"
	depends on ARCH_S3C24xx
	help
	  Add support for processor's NAND device controller.

config MTD_NAND_ECC_SW_HAMMING_SMC
	bool "NAND ECC Smart Media byte order"
	default n
	help
	  Software ECC according to the Smart Media Specification.
	  The original Linux implementation had byte 0 and 1 swapped.

config MTD_NAND_NOMADIK
	tristate "ST Nomadik 8815 NAND support"
	depends on ARCH_NOMADIK
	help
	  Driver for the NAND flash controller on the Nomadik, with ECC.

config MTD_NAND_DENALI
        tristate "Support Denali NAND controller"
        depends on HAS_DMA
        help
          Enable support for the Denali NAND controller.  This should be
          combined with either the PCI or platform drivers to provide device
          registration.
